# Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

The PyTorch Forecasting library provides implementations of standard Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures based on either Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) cells.

An illustration of typical RNN architectures is available [here](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-230/cheatsheet-recurrent-neural-networks).
