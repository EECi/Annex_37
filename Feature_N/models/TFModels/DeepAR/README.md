# DeepAR

DeepAR, proposed in [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301888), is "a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an autoregressive recurrent neural network model on a large number of related time series", developed by Amazon. A explanation of the operation of the model is available in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/deepar-mastering-time-series-forecasting-with-deep-learning-bc717771ce85).

An example usage of the model from the pytorch-forecasting docs is available [here](https://pytorch-forecasting.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/deepar.html).
