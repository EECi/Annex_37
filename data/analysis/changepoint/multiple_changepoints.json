    "_comment": "Selected 7 buildings where the trend changepoints are expected to most improved model performance (i.e. highest probs and best spread). For these buildings, the 5 highest probability valid changepoints (in period mid. 2010 to mid. 2016) are used for training (unless fewer than 5 sensible changepoints exist). Testing is performance in chronological order. This also gives a nice spread across mean loads and similarity scores.",
